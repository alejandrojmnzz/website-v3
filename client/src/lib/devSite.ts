/**
 * DEV SITE OVERRIDE — client-side half of the file-based approach
 * ================================================================
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: .local/dev-site-override (server-side file)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The active site domain is stored in a plain text file on the server.
 * siteResolutionMiddleware reads it synchronously on EVERY request, which
 * means SSR, API calls, and page navigations all resolve to the correct site.
 *
 * localStorage is a CLIENT-SIDE MIRROR only.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * We keep a copy in localStorage so that injectDevSite() can append
 * ?__site=<domain> to all API fetches as belt-and-suspenders
 * (useful e.g. after HMR before a full reload clears the in-memory cache).
 * localStorage is NEVER the source of truth for site resolution — that is
 * always the server file.
 *
 * ⚠️  DO NOT REPLACE localStorage WITH COOKIES — EVER.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * We spent significant time debugging a cookie-based approach. Here is why
 * cookies do not work in the Replit dev environment:
 *
 *   Replit's workspace embeds the app (worf.replit.dev) in an iframe inside
 *   replit.com. Modern browsers (Chrome 115+, Edge) treat the app's domain
 *   as a THIRD-PARTY origin relative to the top-level page (replit.com).
 *   In this context:
 *
 *   — document.cookie writes on the client are silently discarded.
 *   — Set-Cookie headers from server responses are silently discarded.
 *   — This applies to SameSite=Lax, SameSite=None; Secure, and every other
 *     cookie attribute combination. All were tested. All fail silently.
 *
 *   The symptom: /api/dev/set-site returns {"ok":true}, the server logs the
 *   call, but the cookie is never stored and never sent on the next request.
 *   The site switcher appears to do nothing.
 *
 *   localStorage is NOT subject to third-party cookie restrictions — it is
 *   scoped to the origin (worf.replit.dev) and always accessible from the
 *   app's own JavaScript, regardless of the iframe context.
 *
 * Write sequence (always in this order):
 *   1. localStorage.setItem(...)   ← synchronous, instant
 *   2. await fetch("/api/dev/set-site?domain=X")  ← server writes the file
 *   3. queryClient.clear()  ← flush all cached data so components re-fetch
 *      for the new site (with ?__site= injected by the global fetch interceptor)
 *
 * In production:
 *   getDevSiteOverride() always returns null. Site resolution is driven by
 *   req.hostname (the actual domain/subdomain). No override is possible.
